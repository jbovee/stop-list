# Stop List
A Chrome extension for opening videos from YouTube playlists with the playlist pieces of the url removed

## About
Stop List adds an option to context menus for YouTube playlist links that will open only the first or indexed video of the playlist. The purpose is to stop auto-generated playlists, such as the Recommended music playlist, from automatically playing the next video in the list.

# Future Ideas
- An option page
  - Whether or not to focus the new tab
